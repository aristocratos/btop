## News

##### 7 January 2024

Btop release v1.3.0

Big release with GPU support added for Linux and platform support for OpenBSD. Big thanks to [@romner-set](https://github.com/romner-set) (GPU support) and [@joske](https://github.com/joske) (OpenBSD support) for contributions.
And a multitude of bugfixes and small changes, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and latest [release](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/releases/latest) for detailed list and attributions.

See news entry below for more information regarding GPU support.

##### 25 November 2023

GPU monitoring added for Linux!

Compile from git main to try it out.

Use keys `5`, `6`, `7` and `0` to show/hide the gpu monitoring boxes. `5` = Gpu 1, `6` = Gpu 2, etc.

Gpu stats/graphs can also be displayed in the "Cpu box" (not as verbose), see the cpu options menu for info and configuration.

Note that the binaries provided on the release page (when released) and the continuous builds will not have gpu support enabled.

Because the GPU support relies on loading of dynamic gpu libraries, gpu support will not work when also static linking.

See [Compilation Linux](#compilation-linux) for more info on how to compile with gpu monitoring support.

Many thanks to [@romner-set](https://github.com/romner-set) who wrote the vast majority of the implementation for GPU support.

Big update with version bump to 1.3 coming soon.

##### 28 August 2022

[![btop4win](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop4win/raw/master/Img/logo.png)](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop4win)

First release of btop4win available at https://github.com/aristocratos/btop4win

<details>
<summary>More...</summary>

##### 16 January 2022

Release v1.2.0 with FreeBSD support. No release binaries for FreeBSD provided as of yet.

Again a big thanks to [@joske](https://github.com/joske) for his porting efforts!

Since compatibility with Linux, macOS and FreeBSD are done, the focus going forward will be on new features like GPU monitoring.

##### 13 November 2021

Release v1.1.0 with macOS support. Binaries in [continuous-build-macos](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/actions/workflows/continuous-build-macos.yml) are only x86 for now.
macOS binaries + installer are included for both x86 and ARM64 (Apple Silicon) in the releases.

Big thank you to [@joske](https://github.com/joske) who wrote the vast majority of the implementation!

##### 30 October 2021

Work on the OSX [macOS] and FreeBSD branches, both initiated and mostly worked on by [@joske](https://github.com/joske), will likely be completed in the coming weeks.
The OSX [macOS] branch has some memory leaks that needs to be sorted out and both have some issues with the processes cpu usage calculation and other smaller issues that needs fixing.

If you want to help out, test for bugs/fix bugs or just try out the branches:

**macOS / OSX**
```bash
# Install and use Homebrew or MacPorts package managers for easy dependency installation
brew install coreutils make gcc@11 lowdown
git clone https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.git
cd btop
git checkout OSX
gmake
```

**FreeBSD**
```bash
sudo pkg install gmake gcc11 coreutils git lowdown
git clone https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.git
cd btop
git checkout freebsd
gmake
```

Note that GNU make (`gmake`) is recommended but not required for macOS/OSX but it is required on FreeBSD.


##### 6 October 2021

macOS development have been started by [@joske](https://github.com/joske), big thanks :)
See branch [OSX](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/tree/OSX) for current progress.

##### 18 September 2021

The Linux version of btop++ is complete. Released as version 1.0.0

I will be providing statically compiled binaries for a range of architectures in every release for those having problems compiling.

For compilation GCC 10 is required, GCC 11 preferred.

Please report any bugs to the [Issues](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/issues/new?assignees=aristocratos&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D) page.

The development plan right now:

* 1.1.0 macOS [OSX] support
* 1.2.0 FreeBSD support
* 1.3.0 Support for GPU monitoring
* 1.X.0 Other platforms and features...

Windows support is not in the plans as of now, but if anyone else wants to take it on, I will try to help.

##### 5 May 2021

This project is gonna take some time until it has complete feature parity with bpytop, since all system information gathering will have to be written from scratch without any external libraries.
And will need some help in the form of code contributions to get complete support for BSD and macOS/OSX.

## Documents

**[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)**

**[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**

**[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**

## Description

Resource monitor that shows usage and stats for processor, memory, disks, network and processes.

C++ version and continuation of [bashtop](https://github.com/aristocratos/bashtop) and [bpytop](https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop).

## Features

* Easy to use, with a game inspired menu system.
* Full mouse support, all buttons with a highlighted key is clickable and mouse scroll works in process list and menu boxes.
* Fast and responsive UI with UP, DOWN keys process selection.
* Function for showing detailed stats for selected process.
* Ability to filter processes.
* Easy switching between sorting options.
* Tree view of processes.
* Send any signal to selected process.
* UI menu for changing all config file options.
* Auto scaling graph for network usage.
* Shows IO activity and speeds for disks.
* Battery meter
* Selectable symbols for the graphs.
* Custom presets
* And more...

## Themes

Btop++ uses the same theme files as bpytop and bashtop (some color values missing in bashtop themes) .

See [themes](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/tree/main/themes) folder for available themes.

The `make install` command places the default themes in `[$PREFIX or /usr/local]/share/btop/themes`.
User created themes should be placed in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/btop/themes` or `$HOME/.config/btop/themes`.

Let me know if you want to contribute with new themes.

## Support and funding

You can sponsor this project through github, see [my sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/aristocratos) for options.

Or donate through [paypal](https://paypal.me/aristocratos) or [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/aristocratos).

Any support is greatly appreciated!

## Prerequisites

For best experience, a terminal with support for:

* 24-bit truecolor ([See list of terminals with truecolor support](https://github.com//termstandard/colors))
* 256-color terminals are supported through 24-bit to 256-color conversion when setting "truecolor" to False in the options or with "-lc/--low-color" arguments.
* 16 color TTY mode will be activated if a real tty device is detected. Can be forced with "-t/--tty_on" arguments.
* Wide characters (Are sometimes problematic in web-based terminals)

Also needs a UTF8 locale and a font that covers:

* Unicode Block “Braille Patterns” U+2800 - U+28FF (Not needed in TTY mode or with graphs set to type: block or tty.)
* Unicode Block “Geometric Shapes” U+25A0 - U+25FF
* Unicode Block "Box Drawing" and "Block Elements" U+2500 - U+259F

### **Optional Dependencies (Needed for GPU monitoring)**

GPU monitoring also requires a btop binary built with GPU support (`GPU_SUPPORT=true` flag).

See [GPU compatibility](#gpu-compatibility) section for more about compiling with GPU support.

 * **NVIDIA**

If you have an NVIDIA GPU you must use an official NVIDIA driver, both the closed-source and open-source ones have been verified to work.

In addition to that you must also have the nvidia-ml dynamic library installed, which should be included with the driver package of your distribution.

 * **AMD**

If you have an AMD GPU `rocm_smi_lib` is required, which may or may not be packaged for your distribution.

### **Notice (Text rendering issues)**

* If you are having problems with the characters in the graphs not looking like they do in the screenshots, it's likely a problem with your systems configured fallback font not having support for braille characters.

* See [Terminess Powerline](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Terminus/terminus-ttf-4.40.1) for an example of a font that includes the braille symbols.

* See comments by @sgleizes [link](https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop/issues/100#issuecomment-684036827) and @XenHat [link](https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop/issues/100#issuecomment-691585587) in issue #100 for possible solutions.

* If text are misaligned and you are using Konsole or Yakuake, turning off "Bi-Directional text rendering" is a possible fix.

* Characters clipping in to each other or text/border misalignments is not bugs caused by btop, but most likely a fontconfig or terminal problem where the braille characters making up the graphs aren't rendered correctly.

* Look to the creators of the terminal emulator you use to fix these issues if the previous mentioned fixes don't work for you.

## Installation

**Binaries for Linux are statically compiled with musl and works on kernel 2.6.39 and newer**

1. **Download btop-(VERSION)-(ARCH)-(PLATFORM).tbz from [latest release](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop/releases/latest) and unpack to a new folder**

   **Notice! Use x86_64 for 64-bit x86 systems, i486 and i686 are 32-bit!**

2. **Install (from created folder)**

   * **Run install.sh or:**

   ```bash
   # use "make install PREFIX=/target/dir" to set target, default: /usr/local
   # only use "sudo" when installing to a NON user owned directory
   sudo make install
   ```

3. **(Optional) Set suid bit to make btop always run as root (or other user)**

   Enables signal sending to any process without starting with `sudo` and can prevent /proc read permissions problems on some systems.

   * **Run setuid.sh or:**

   ```bash
   # run after make install and use same PREFIX if any was used at install
   # set SU_USER and SU_GROUP to select user and group, default is root:root
   sudo make setuid
   ```

* **Uninstall**

  * **Run uninstall.sh or:**

   ```bash
   sudo make uninstall
   ```

* **Show help**

   ```bash
   make help
   ```

**Binary release on Homebrew (macOS (x86_64 & ARM64) / Linux (x86_64))**

* **[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/btop)**
  ```bash
  brew install btop
  ```

## Compilation Linux

   Requires at least GCC 10 or Clang 16.

   The makefile also needs GNU coreutils and `sed` (should already be installed on any modern distribution).

   ### GPU compatibility

   Btop++ supports NVIDIA and AMD GPUs out of the box on Linux x86_64, provided you have the correct drivers and libraries.

   Compatibility with Intel GPUs using generic DRM calls is planned, as is compatibility for FreeBSD and macOS.

   Gpu support will not work when static linking glibc (or musl, etc.)!

   For x86_64 Linux the flag `GPU_SUPPORT` is automatically set to `true`, to manually disable gpu support set the flag to false, like:

   `make GPU_SUPPORT=false` (or `cmake -DBTOP_GPU=false` with CMake)

 * **NVIDIA**

    You must use an official NVIDIA driver, both the closed-source and [open-source](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules) ones have been verified to work.

    In addition to that you must also have the `nvidia-ml` dynamic library installed, which should be included with the driver package of your distribution.

 * **AMD**

    AMDGPU data is queried using the [ROCm SMI](https://github.com/rocm/rocm_smi_lib) library, which may or may not be packaged for your distribution. If your distribution doesn't provide a package, btop++ is statically linked to ROCm SMI with the `RSMI_STATIC=true` make flag.

    This flag expects the ROCm SMI source code in `lib/rocm_smi_lib`, and compilation will fail if it's not there. The latest tested version is 5.6.x, which can be obtained with the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rocm/rocm_smi_lib.git --depth 1 -b rocm-5.6.x lib/rocm_smi_lib
   ```

1. **Install dependencies (example for Ubuntu 21.04 Hirsute)**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install coreutils sed git build-essential gcc-11 g++-11 lowdown
   ```

2. **Clone repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.git
   cd btop
   ```

3. **Compile**

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   Options for make:

   | Flag                            | Description                                                             |
   |---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | `VERBOSE=true`                  | To display full compiler/linker commands                                |
   | `STATIC=true`                   | For static compilation                                                  |
   | `QUIET=true`                    | For less verbose output                                                 |
   | `STRIP=true`                    | To force stripping of debug symbols (adds `-s` linker flag)             |
   | `DEBUG=true`                    | Sets OPTFLAGS to `-O0 -g` and enables more verbose debug logging        |
   | `ARCH=<architecture>`           | To manually set the target architecture                                 |
   | `FORTIFY_SOURCE=false`          | Disable fortification with `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3`                          |
   | `GPU_SUPPORT=<true\|false>`     | Enable/disable GPU support (Enabled by default on X86_64 Linux)         |
   | `RSMI_STATIC=true`              | To statically link the ROCm SMI library used for querying AMDGPU        |
   | `ADDFLAGS=<flags>`              | For appending flags to both compiler and linker                         |
   | `CXX=<compiler>`                | Manually set which compiler to use                                       |

   Example: `make ADDFLAGS=-march=native` might give a performance boost if compiling only for your own system.

   Notice! If using LDAP Authentication, usernames will show as UID number for LDAP users if compiling statically with glibc.

4. **Install**

   ```bash
   sudo make install
   ```

   Append `PREFIX=/target/dir` to set target, default: `/usr/local`

   Notice! Only use "sudo" when installing to a NON user owned directory.

5. **(Optional) Set suid bit to make btop always run as root (or other user)**

   ```bash
   sudo make setuid
   ```

   No need for `sudo` to enable signal sending to any process and to prevent /proc read permissions problems on some systems.

   Run after make install and use same PREFIX if any was used at install.

   Set `SU_USER` and `SU_GROUP` to select user and group, default is `root` and `root`

* **Uninstall**

   ```bash
   sudo make uninstall
   ```

* **Remove any object files from source dir**

   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

* **Remove all object files, binaries and created directories in source dir**

### With CMake (Community maintained)
</summary>

1. **Install build dependencies**

   Requires Clang / GCC, CMake, Ninja, Lowdown and Git

   For example, with Debian Bookworm:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install cmake git g++ ninja-build lowdown
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.git && cd btop
   ``````

3. **Compile**

   ```bash
   # Configure
   cmake -B build -G Ninja
   # Build
   cmake --build build
   ```

   This will automatically build a release version of btop.

   Some useful options to pass to the configure step:

   | Configure flag                  | Description                                                             |
   |---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | `-DBTOP_STATIC=<ON\|OFF>`       | Enables static linking (OFF by default)                                 |
   | `-DBTOP_LTO=<ON\|OFF>`          | Enables link time optimization (ON by default)                          |
   | `-DBTOP_USE_MOLD=<ON\|OFF>`     | Use mold to link btop (OFF by default)                                  |
   | `-DBTOP_PEDANTIC=<ON\|OFF>`     | Compile with additional warnings (OFF by default)                       |
   | `-DBTOP_WERROR=<ON\|OFF>`       | Compile with warnings as errors (OFF by default)                        |
   | `-DBTOP_FORTIFY=<ON\|OFF>`      | Detect buffer overflows with `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3` (ON by default)        |
   | `-DBTOP_GPU=<ON\|OFF>`          | Enable GPU support (ON by default)                                      |
   | `-DBTOP_RSMI_STATIC=<ON\|OFF>`  | Build and link the ROCm SMI library statically (OFF by default)         |
   | `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>` | The installation prefix ('/usr/local' by default)                       |

   To force any other compiler, run `CXX=<compiler> cmake -B build -G Ninja`

4. **Install**

   ```bash
   cmake --install build
   ```

   May require root privileges

5. **Uninstall**

   CMake doesn't generate an uninstall target by default. To remove installed files, run
   ```
   cat build/install_manifest.txt | xargs rm -irv
   ```

6. **Cleanup build directory**

   ```bash
   cmake --build build -t clean
   ```

## Compilation macOS OSX

   Requires at least GCC 10 or Clang 16.

   With GCC, version 12 (or better) is needed for macOS Ventura. If you get linker errors on Ventura you'll need to upgrade your command line tools (Version 14.0) is bugged.

   The makefile also needs GNU coreutils and `sed`.

   Install and use Homebrew or MacPorts package managers for easy dependency installation

1. **Install build dependencies**

   Requires Clang, CMake, Ninja, Lowdown and Git

   ```bash
   brew update --quiet
   brew install cmake git llvm ninja lowdown
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.git && cd btop
   ```

3. **Compile**

   ```bash
   # Configure
   export LLVM_PREFIX="$(brew --prefix llvm)"
   export CXX="$LLVM_PREFIX/bin/clang++"
   export CPPFLAGS="-I$LLVM_PREFIX/include"
   export LDFLAGS="-L$LLVM_PREFIX/lib -L$LLVM_PREFIX/lib/c++ -Wl,-rpath,$LLVM_PREFIX/lib/c++ -fuse-ld=$LLVM_PREFIX/bin/ld64.lld"
   cmake -B build -G Ninja
   # Build
   cmake --build build
   ```

   _**Note:** btop uses lots of C++ 20 features, so it's necessary to be specific about the compiler and the standard library. If you get a compile with Apple-Clang or GCC, feel free to add the instructions here._

   This will automatically build a release version of btop.

   Some useful options to pass to the configure step:

   | Configure flag                  | Description                                                             |
   |---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | `-DBTOP_LTO=<ON\|OFF>`          | Enables link time optimization (ON by default)                          |
   | `-DBTOP_USE_MOLD=<ON\|OFF>`     | Use mold to link btop (OFF by default)                                  |
   | `-DBTOP_PEDANTIC=<ON\|OFF>`     | Compile with additional warnings (OFF by default)                       |
   | `-DBTOP_WERROR=<ON\|OFF>`       | Compile with warnings as errors (OFF by default)                        |
   | `-DBTOP_FORTIFY=<ON\|OFF>`      | Detect buffer overflows with `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3` (ON by default)        |
   | `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>` | The installation prefix ('/usr/local' by default)                       |

   To force any specific compiler, run `CXX=<compiler> cmake -B build -G Ninja`

4. **Install**

   ```bash
   cmake --install build
   ```

   May require root privileges

5. **Uninstall**

   CMake doesn't generate an uninstall target by default. To remove installed files, run
   ```
   cat build/install_manifest.txt | xargs rm -irv
   ```

6. **Cleanup build directory**

   ```bash
   cmake --build build -t clean
   ```

## Installing the snap
[![btop](https://snapcraft.io/btop/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/btop)

### Note: there are now two snaps available: `btop` and `btop-desktop`. The desktop version is much larger and includes the desktop entries needed to allow for launching `btop` with a click.

 * **Install the snap**

    ```bash
    sudo snap install btop
    or
    sudo snap install btop-desktop
    ```
 * **Install the latest snap from the edge channel**
   ```
   sudo snap install btop --edge
   or
   sudo snap install btop-desktop --edge
   ```

 * **Connect the interface**

    ```bash
	sudo snap connect btop:removable-media
	or
	sudo snap connect btop-desktop:removable-media
